                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Hoopers.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>Hoopers is a mobile web app developed by my team of three for my Interaction & Design class. Using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express.js, jQuery, and Bootstrap, our team designed and created a web-app to let users find basketball
                    pickup games in their area and help them track their previous game scores and game statistics. </p>
                <p>My primary role in this project was to create HTML pages, style them with CSS, and incorporate Leaflet's API for our map feature. I learned a lot about the power of Twitter's Bootstrap and our team used it extensively throughout our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides front-end development, our team also focused on UI and UX by performing user testing, storyboards, prototyping, and interviews in order to create a UI and UX friendly app. My team went through several iterations of design before finally settling
                    on our final result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Special thanks to my teammates: Ashley Chen and Anuraj Dash. I wish them the best in their future endeavors and enjoyed working with them immensely on this project.
